- **Abstract**:
 
> JSON and binary-JSON formats are ubiquitously supported but are designed largely
for storage of lightweight hierarchical data. However, when accessing large data records
inside a JSON/binary-JSON file, file reading and writing can be slow. This specification
aims to define a lightweight memory-mapping (mmap) table to enable fast disk-mapped
file IO for JSON and binary JSON formats. A JSON-Mmap table can be embedded in the same
data file or store in a separate file. Using the byte-offset/length information stored
in the JSON-Mmap allows to read or update particular data record without needing to parse
or overwrite the entire data file, leading to dramatic performance improvement.

Introduction

### Background
 
 
The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format has been ubiquitously supported among
today's web and native applications for efficient exchange of hierarchical data.
It is human-readable, lightweight and fast to parse, thanks to its simple syntax.
JSON-compatible readers and writers are widely supported among nearly all programming
environments. Despite its proliferated use, JSON has limitations. JSON is highly efficient
when storing and exchanging lightweight data records, but when storing highly complex
hierarchical data and large data records (such as large arrays), JSON parsers and writers
exhibit low file-IO efficiency. A commonly used technique, memory-mapped (**mmap**) file I/O,
for accelerating disk-based data access, can only be used for binary-files with fixed/rigid
structures, and are not generally applicable to JSON files.
 
To address the file-IO efficiency issue, a number of binary-JSON formats have been proposed,
including [BSON (Binary JSON)](http://bson.org), [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org),
[CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation, [RFC 7049])](https://cbor.io),
[UBJSON (Universal Binary JSON)](http://ubjson.org) and [BJData (Binary JData)](https://neurojson.org/bjdata).
Using binary-JSON formats to store JSON-based hierarchical data in strongly-typed binary
forms can significantly reduce file sizes, as well as reading/writing overheads.
However, when reading/writing large binary data records such as an N-dimensional (ND)
array (ND-arrays), binary-JSON parsers may still show inferior efficiency compared
to mmap-based binary file IO over traditional fixed-sized binary files (which lack of
the capability of extension compared to JSON and binary JSON).
 
### Overview
 
In this specification, we aim to define a lightweight JSON-based mmap-table structure that
can be embedded inside a JSON or binary JSON file or stored side-by-side along the JSON/binary
JSON file to dramatically enhance their file IO efficiencies. The JSON-Mmap table is lightweight
and follows a simple structure to record essential serialization data of key records, including
disk/memory linear byte-offset and length, with fine-grained capability to access individual
data elements. Reading/writing JSON-Mmap table does not require additional parser/writer
because it must be stored/accessed using the same format as the respective associated
data file (JSON or binary-JSON). Creating and utilizing JSON-Mmap records
can be particularly beneficial when using the combination of JSON/[BJData](https://neurojson.org/bjdata)
serializations with language-independent semantic [JData-based annotations](https://neurojson.org/jdata)
for storage and exchange of large-sized scientific data files such as medical imaging scans.
 
Syntax
------------------------
 
A JSON-Mmap must be written as an **array of arrays**, with each element being an
**array of minimum two elements**, as shown in the below form
 
```javascript
[
    [ "name1", value1 ],
    [ "name2", value2 ],
    ...
    [ "path1", [...]  ],
    [ "path2", [...]  ],
    ...
]
```
 
In each of the sub-arrays,
- the first element must be a string; such string can be one of the two cases:
    - a string starting with ASCII letter `$` (`0x24` in hex, ASCII code 36) is referred to as
      a **path**, representing a [JSON-Path](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) styled reference,
      pointing towards a specific data record to the associated JSON/binary JSON file, and
    - any string that does not start with `$` is referred to as a **metadata key**, to store
      optional auxiliary information related to the JSON-Mmap,
- when the first string is a **path**, the second element must be an array of numeric values, hereinafter
  referred to as the **locator vector**, containing various information regarding the byte-location of the
  serialized data record on the disk or memory buffer
- when the frist string is a **metadata key**, the second element denotes the value of the metadata,
  some recommended metadata key value formats are listed below.
 
### Significant and insignificant characters
 
In a JSON document, zero or more permitted whitespaces can be inserted between data items without alternating
the data structure stored in the document. Four whitespace characters are permitted:
 
- space (` `): 0x20 in hex (ASCII code: 32)
- linefeed (`\n`): 0x0A in hex (ASCII code: 20)
- carrage return (`\r`): 0x0D in hex (ASCII code: 13)
- horizontal tab (`\t`): 0x09 in hex (ASCII code: 9)
 
We call the above whitespace characters as **insignificant characters** and all non-whitespace
characters as **significant characters** in a JSON document.
 
Similarly, in a BJData/UBJSON document, zero or more `no-op` markers `N` can be inserted between data
items without alternating the data stored in such a file. As a result, we call the `no-op` marker `N` as
the **insignificant character** and all other bytes that are not `no-op` are called **significant characters**
when referencing a BJData or UBJSON data file.
 
Other binary JSON formats such as CBOR and MessagePack do not support `no-op` markers or optional
whitespaces, therefore, all bytes in these files are considered significant characters.
 
### Path string
 
The format of the path string is inspired and largely similar to the syntax of
[JSON-Path](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-goessner-dispatch-jsonpath-00.html), where
the string must follow the below format
 
|      Notation      |                                                   Meaning                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`$`                 | the root object, must be the first letter of all paths                                                      |
|`$i`                | i=0,1,2,..., denoting the (i+1)th root-level object in an concatenated JSON (CJSON) or binary JSON document |
|`.`                 | child of the object to the left                                                                             |
|`[i]`               | i=0,1,2,..., denoting the (i+1)th child of an array to the left                                             |
|`.key` or `.['key']`| a named child with a string-typed name `key`; using `['key']` is required when `key` has `.` ,`[` or `]`    |
 
Note: JSON-Mmap path specifier does not support additional syntax in JSON-Path, such as `..` or `@` operator
 
For example, for the below JSON (or JSON-like) object
 
```json
{
    "name": "Andy",
    "school": "Hood",
    "schedule": {
        "Monday": [8,12],
        "Tuesday": null,
        "Friday": {
            "AM": 9,
            "PM": [14.5, 15.5]
        }
    }
}
{
    "name": "Leo",
    "school": "Hood",
    "schedule": {
        "Wednesday": [10]
    }
}
```
the following
|                 Path               |                  Reference Value                          |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`$0.name`                           | "Andy"                                                    |
|`$0.schedule.Monday[0]`             | 8                                                         |
|`$0.schedule.Friday.AM`             | 9                                                         |
|`$0.schedule.Friday.PM`             | [14.5, 15.5]                                              |
|`$0.schedule.Friday.PM[1]`          | 15.5                                                      |
|`$0['schedule']['Friday']['PM'][1]` | 15.5 (same as above)                                      |
|`$1`                                | the entire 2nd root-level object `{"name":"Leo",...}`     |
|`$1.schedule`                       | the value of the `schedule` object `{"Wednesday": [10]}`  |
 
 
### Locator vector
 
The locator vector must be an array (can be empty). It should have the following form
```
[<start>, <length>, <whitespace-byte-length-before>, <whitespace-byte-length-after> ...]
```
where
 
- (recommended) the first number `<start>`, if present, must be an integer, denoting the byte position
  (starting from 1) of the first significant character of the referenced value from the start of
  the referenced document (defined in [Storage of the JSON-Mmap table](#storage-of-the-json-mmap-table)),
- (recommended) the second number `<length>`, if present, must be an intger, denoting the end-to-end byte-length
  of the referenced value between the first and the last significant character (including both ends),
- (optional) the third number, `<whitespace-byte-length-before>`, if present, must be an integer, denoting the
  byte-length of all whitespaces (insignificant character) **before** the first significant character and
  after the separator mark `,` with the preceding objects, or a significant character of the enclosing parent object,
- (optional) the fourth number, `<whitespace-byte-length-after>`, if present, must be an integer, denoting the
  byte-length of all whitespaces (insignificant character) **after** the last significant character and
  before the separator mark `,` with the following objects, or the next significant character of the parent object,
- additional elements in the locator vector are reserved for future extension of this specification
 
Both the optional `<whitespace-byte-length-before>` and `<whitespace-byte-length-after>` records are
designed for the purpose of **in-place on-disk value replacement** of the data records. See
[Sample utilities of JSON-Mmap](#sample-utilities-of-json-mmap) section for detailed discussions.
 
For example, for the below JSON string buffer
```javascript
1         11        21        31        41        51        61        71        81 (byte index)
1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9
{"name" :  "Andy" , "schedule": { "Mon": [ 10 , 14], "Tue": null, "Wed":10.5 } }
           ^--                  ^--      ^--                ^--         ^--    : starting positions
         --                    -        - -    -          -                    : preceding whitespaces
```
 
the corresponding JSON-Mmap is
```json
[
    ["$",                [1, 80]],
    ["$.name",           [12, 6, 2]],
    ["$.schedule",       [33, 47, 1]],
    ["$.schedule.Mon",   [42, 10, 1]],
    ["$.schedule.Mon[1]",[49, 2, 1]],
    ["$.schedule.Tue",   [64, 4, 1]],
    ["$.schedule.Wed",   [73, 4]]
]
```
**Note**: a JSON-Mmap does not have to contain mappings of all data elements of a document; it may contain
only a selected subset of data elements.
 
Similarly, the above JSON document can also be stored as a compact [BJData](https://neurojson.org/bjdata/draft2)/
[UBJSON](http://ubjson.org/) buffer in the below form (here numbers are printed in ASCII form instead
of their binary forms; we adjusted the byte-index indicators accordingly to match their correct binary
lengths; the `name` section of the data are underscored for easy readability)
 
```javascript
1         11        21        31          41          53        61        71    (byte index)
1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3  5  7 9 1 3 5 7 9   3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3
{U4nameSU4AndyU4schedule{U3Mon[i10i14]U3TueZU3Wedd10.5}}
 ______       __________ _____        _____ _____
```
the corresponding JSON-Mmap is
```json
[
    ["$",                [1, 54]],
    ["$.name",           [8, 7]],
    ["$.schedule",       [25, 19]],
    ["$.schedule.Mon",   [31, 6]],
    ["$.schedule.Mon[1]",[34, 2]],
    ["$.schedule.Tue",   [42, 1]],
    ["$.schedule.Wed",   [48, 5]]
]
```
 
The JSON-Mmap does not have to contain records for all sub-elements. It may store only a subset of the
data records, especially those that require fast access, such as a large array or binary buffer.
 
## Metadata keys and values
 
Optionally, one can add `["name", value]` pairs in the form of a 2-element array in the JSON-Mmap to
provide additional metadata information. In such a case, the `"name"` string must not start with the letter `$`.
 
To ensure high performance when using JSON-Mmap, it is highly recommended to only use simple value
forms, such as numbers or strings, in the metadata entries.
 
In the below table, we show a list of metadata examples.
 
|                 Metadata Pair                |                          Utility                           |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|`["MmapVersion", "0.5"]`                      | the JSON-Mmap specification version number                 |
|`["ReferenceFileName","data.json"]`           | the original referenced/associated data file name          |
|`["ReferenceFileURI","https://.../data.json"]`| the original referenced/associated data file URL           |
|`["ReferenceFileBytes": 92021]`               | the byte size of the referenced/associated data file       |
|`["ReferenceFileSHA256", "0ACA987B..."]`      | a string storing the SHA256 hash key of the referenced file|
|`["Comment", "a user-defined comment"]`       | a comment                                                  |
|`["MmapByteLength", 2560]`                    | the total byte-length of the mmap table(include this entry)|
 
The file location metadata such as `"ReferenceFileName"` and `"ReferenceFileURI"` are
only for information purposes only, and shall not be in conflict with the rules defining the start of
the referenced data, depending on the storage location of the JSON-Mmap as detailed in the below section.
 
### Storage of the JSON-Mmap table
 
The JSON-Mmap table can be stored in 3 possible locations, detailed below.
 
#### Inline direct form
 
The JSON-Mmap can be directly stored as the header of the referenced JSON/binary
JSON data in the form of a concatenated JSON object. An example is shown below
 
```javascript
[
    ["MmapVersion", "0.5"],
    ["Comment", "mmap for data1"],
    ["$",     [...]],
    ["$.key", [...]],
    ...
]{
    data1
}
```
 
An inline JSON-Mmap is automatically assumed to be associated with the concatenated
JSON object immediately following the mmap table; the `start` record in
all **locator vector** assumes the start of the referenced data buffer immediately
follows the last significant character of the JSON-Mmap (in the above case,
the closing bracket `]`).
 
When whitespaces are inserted between the JSON-Mmap and the following JSON object,
such as new-lines `\n` or spaces, the length of such padded bytes must be counted
in the `start` records in all locator vectors.
 
Multiple inline JSON-Mmap tables can be used in the same document, each preceding
its associated JSON object, for example
 
```javascript
[["Comment", "mmap for data1"], ["$", [...]],...]{data1}
[["Comment", "mmap for data2"], ["$", [...]],...]{data2}
```
 
#### Inline embedded form
 
When a JSON-Mmap table is not directly stored as a root-level object, such as shown in the
below example as a sub-element of a root-level object `"_DataInfo_"`, the JSON-Mmap is
assumed to be associated with the concatenated JSON object immediately following the last
significant character of the root-level container that encloses the mmap table (in this case,
the closing `}` of the `"_DataInfo_"` object).
 
```javascript
{
    "_DataInfo_": {
        "Creator": "NeuroJSON",
        "Comment": "JSON-Mmap table demo",
        "mmap": [
            ["MmapVersion", "0.5"],
            ["Comment", "mmap for data1"],
            ["$",     [...]],
            ["$.key", [...]],
            ...
        ]
    }
}{
    data1
}
```
 
Similar to the inline direct form, multiple embedded JSON-Mmap tables can be used in the same
document as references to multiple subsequent root-level JSON objects.
 
#### Standalone form
 
A JSON-Mmap can also be stored in a standalone file separately from the associated
data file. A user or application must apply the mmap to its matching associated data
file. Failure to do so may result in corrupted data records. It is suggested to use
the `ReferenceFileSHA256` hash key, if present, to ensure the appropriate match of
the mmap and its referenced data.
 
Below, we show an example of a paired JSON-Mmap and data files.
 
Standalone JSON-mmap file `data1.json.jmmap`:
```javascript
[
    ["MmapVersion", "0.5"],
    ["ReferenceFileName", "data1.json"],
    ["ReferenceFileSHA256", "099AC812..."],
    ["$",     [...]],
    ["$.key", [...]],
    ...
]
```
and the associated data file `data1.json`:
```javascript
{
    data1
}
```
 
For a standalone JSON-Mmap file, there should be no significant character appearing after
the last significant character of the mmap record (if in direct form) or its enclosing
root-level container (if in embedded form).
 
Sample utilities of JSON-Mmap
------------------------------
 
When parsing a JSON or binary JSON file in which JSON-Mmap records are anticipated, an efficient
parser may take advantage of the byte-offset/length information present in such data structure
to achieve high performance file reading and writing.
 
### Fast read-only data-level access
 
For simple files containing inline JSON-Mmap tables, the parser is recommended to read only the
first root-level object and identify whether it contains an mmap table. If an mmap table is found,
the parser can then utilize the individual data record information in mmap to achieve fast read-only
access to individual records without needing to read/parse the entire referenced data buffer.
 
```
[
    ["$.key", [14,4,1]]
]{
    "key": 1024
}
```
 
On can utilize the `start` and `length` information from the mmap table to quickly read/parse
a specific data record without needing to read/parse the entire data file
 
The below C-code snippet conceptually demonstrates one of many ways to utilize such
information in data reading.
 
```c
int read_json_int_key(const int start, const int length, int *value, const char *datafile){
    FILE fp=fopen(datafile, "rb");
    if(fp==NULL)
        return 1;
    if(fseek(fp, start-1, SEEK_SET))
        return 1;
    if(fscanf(fp, "%d", value)!=1)
        return 1;
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```
 
### On-disk value replacement with equal or less bytes
 
Using mmap information, one can also quickly update specific data records inside a large
JSON/binary JSON file without needing to overwrite the entire document.
 
As discussed above, removing or adding insignificant characters (whitespaces in JSON
or `N` markers in UBJSON/BJData) before or after a data record makes no impact to the integrity
of the data file. Therefore, when updating a specified data record, the maximum byte that is
available to write user-defined new value can be expressed by
```
maxlength = <length> + <whitespace-byte-length-before> + <whitespace-byte-length-after>
```
where `<length>`, `<whitespace-byte-length-before>`, `<whitespace-byte-length-after>` are the 2nd,
3rd and 4th elements of the locator vector, if present. If any of these values do not present,
the worst-case can be estimated by setting it to 0.
 
Two scenarios are considered: if the byte length to store the new value is shorter or equal to
the estimated `maxlength`, then, one should be able to directly overwrite the existing value
in the associated file or stream, such as the example C-code shown below.
 
```c
int update_json_int_key(const int start, const int length, const int wspre, const int wspost,
                       const int newvalue, const char *datafile){
    int maxlength = length + wspre + wspost;
    FILE fp=fopen(datafile, "rb");
    if(fp==NULL)
        return 1;
    if(fseek(fp, start-wspre-1, SEEK_SET))
        return 1;
 
    char *buf=malloc(maxlength);
    int len=snprintf(buf, maxlength, "%d", newvalue);
    if(len < maxlength)
        memset(buf+len, ' ', maxlength - len);
    if(fwrite(buf, maxlength, 1, fp)!=1){
        free(buf);
        return 1;
    }
    free(buf);
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```
 
### On-disk value replacement with more bytes
 
When storing the new value requires more bytes than the available on-disk byte length of the
old value (including pre- and post-insignificant characters), one may have to make a choice
between several options:
 
- one may warn the user of over-length and refuse to write the new value;
- one may truncate the data, when permitted, and store partial data;
- one may write a compact JSON-Path like path reference, such as `"$1"`, in the place of the
  original record, and point it to a new data record appended at the end of the file/stream.
 
In the last case, for a single-digit number of new root-level JSON object, such as `"$1"`, it only
requires a minimum of 4 bytes to store such a path pointer. The parsers of data files containing
such reference strings shall scan such pointer values and expand the data to the referenced
location.
 
 
Recommended File Specifiers
------------------------------
 
For JSON-based files containing either standalone or inline JSON-Mmap records, the
recommended file suffix is **`".jmmap"`**; for binary-JData (BJData) based files containing
either standalone or inline JSON-Mmap records, the recommended file suffix is **`".bmmap"`**.
 
 
Summary
----------
 
Generating and utilizing the above defined lightweight JSON-Mmap table along side with a
JSON or binary JSON document may permit a user to rapidly locate, read, overwrite or extend
data of interest without needing to read/parse/write the entire document, resulting in
significant file IO performance improvement. It is particularly beneficial for
read-only access of a hierarchical JSON/binary JSON document and one can directly utilize
conventional `mmap` based disk access to rapidly retrieve the data using the information
encoded in the JSON-Mmap table. We anticipate that enabling `mmap` access to JSON and binary
JSON data files can dramatically accelerate reading/writing efficiency in speed critical
applications without adding major overhead.
